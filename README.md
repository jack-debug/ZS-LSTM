# ZS-LSTM
An LSTM that is based on the theory of Zero-sum games
## Model
The program consists of 2 LSTMs which are engaging in a Zero-sum game where after 10 epochs, the LSTM with the best score will be awarded and the LSTM with the worst will be penalized. This competition in theory could help speed up training.
